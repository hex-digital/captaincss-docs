# CaptainCSS Documentation

CaptainCSS' documentation is a fork of [Tailwind Docs](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com). This allows us
to maintain a common look and feel between our documentation and Tailwind's, so you can feel right at home.

CaptainCSS uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for its documentation. Here is how you can run the project locally:

1. Clone this repo

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/hex-digital/captaincss-docs.git
    ```

2. Go into the project root directory

    ```sh
    cd captaincss-docs
    ```

3. Install JS dependencies

    ```sh
    yarn
    ```

4. Start the dev server

    ```sh
    yarn dev
    ```

Alternatively you can generate a static export of the documentation using the `yarn export` command. The export will be saved in the `out` folder.
