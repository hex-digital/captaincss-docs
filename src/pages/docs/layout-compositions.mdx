## <Heading hidden>Wrapper composition</Heading>

There are a number of layout compositions we find ourselves creating time and again. Some are commonly recognised, and siphoned off to
components or classes. And some we don't recognise, but re-implement in specific contexts each time we need it.

Take a wrapper for example. We could build it out of utility classes like this:

```html lightBlue
<div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 md:px-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-10">
  ...
</div>
```

You might have a different name for this. Perhaps a container, or a content stripe. Whatever you call it, I think it's
quite likely you use it on the majority of your projects. I certainly do, and it's one of the first things I would create
when starting a project from scratch.

In order to get away from repeating these class names everywhere, we can put it into a Web Component or a JS Framework component.

```html lightBlue
<template>
  <div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 md:px-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-10">
    <slot />
  </div>
</template>
```

And this is simple enough for a basic wrapper. I think a lot of people know what a wrapper is and how to use it. I think
it's a common composition. Captain provides it as a single class, `.wrapper`, and bakes its configuration into `tailwind.config.js`. 
Super easy. Use it anywhere, on any project, with any framework (or none).

But how many more compositions do you use? If you've never thought about this, then I think there are likely to be a few 
that you use, perhaps under different names, and I think there are likely to be ones you create each time you need
a layout that could be generalised into a composition.

## What are compositions?

A brief intermission to talk about compositions, or layout objects.

Layout objects are the reusable abstractions of repetitive, shared and purely structural aspects of UI. This means things
like wrappers, containers, stacks, clusters, etc.

**"It allows them to exist as non-cosmetic styles that handle the skeletal aspect of a lot of UI components, without ever actually
looking like designed 'things'."** - [Harry Roberts - CSS Wizardry](https://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/).

In other words, adding layout objects to a page on their own wouldn't show anything, but when putting content in to them, they
shape how the content sits on the page. They define the layout of that content.

## Another composition - Cluster

Another composition that I hadn't thought about until I read about it on [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev)
was the [Cluster](/docs/cluster). The cluster allows the positioning of elements, like links or buttons, that space themselves
evenly apart from each other, even when they wrap, and without any extra spacing around it.

Before having the Cluster in my arsenal, I would have created a new component, made it `display: flex` and `flex-wrap: wrap`. Then 
tried to add margins to it, made sure they didn't apply to the first child, and if it wrapped then add a top margin, but not
to the first row, and on and on...

And I would do that each time I needed a set of buttons next to each other, or some list items, or whatever it was. I
didn't have this reusable composition that had this problem solved already.

But with the cluster, it's as simple as throwing the buttons into a `cluster` composition, and they'll be perfectly spaced,
horizontally and vertically with no headaches, everytime.

```html lightBlue
<div class="cluster">
  <div> <!-- Required until  -->
    <button>Act Now</button>
    <button>Do something else</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

And this isn't a new, radical concept for Tailwind. In fact, **Tailwind already has a composition** itself: [The Container](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/container).
It's creating standards under a common name and implementation.

Take a look at the rest of the Objects in Captain and see if there's any you already use, and if there's any you hadn't
thought of before. And if you have more to add, come talk about them [in GitHub](https://github.com/hex-digital/captaincss).
