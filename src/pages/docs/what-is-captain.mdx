## <Heading hidden>Overview</Heading>

Captain is a plugin for Tailwind, that provides new utilities for layouts, accessibility and helpers, fully configurable and ready to go.

Everything you expect from Tailwind is available with Captain, including theme configuration, variations, plugin disabling and more.

Most importantly, **CaptainCSS is built with the aim of fitting anyone's style of writing CSS**. Whether that's just using Tailwind straight up as a utility framework,
or if you prefer [CubeCSS](https://cube.fyi/), [BEMIT](https://csswizardry.com/2015/08/bemit-taking-the-bem-naming-convention-a-step-further/) 
or one of the other successful and acclaimed methodologies, CaptainCSS aims to accommodate you.

## CaptainCSS is built on three core concepts

- Provide **layout compositions and tools** that are useful no matter what kind of project you're working on 
- Provide a **common language** for developers to use when talking about these common patterns 
- And most importantly, **fit with how you like to write CSS**

We recognise there is no one right or best way to write CSS, so we've tried to make CaptainCSS as flexible as possible. No
pressure to learn anything new or change what works for you.
