description: Understanding which browsers Captain supports and how to manage vendor prefixes.

CaptainCSS is designed for and tested on the latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. CaptainCSS does not support any version of IE, including IE 11.

## Vendor Prefixes

Captain does not add any vendor prefixes itself.

See [Tailwind's recommendation for managing vendor prefixes here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/browser-support).
