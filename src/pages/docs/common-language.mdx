## <Heading hidden>Why use common names</Heading>

One of CaptainCSS' core concepts is to provide a shared language for common, repetitive layout objects and compositions.

Naming concepts and patterns is what makes them easy to talk about. Without a common name, developers would need to re-explain 
a particular concept each time they wanted to talk about it, or risk not being on the same page.

It's the same principle for why design patterns have names like Dependency Injection or Containers. If you know about them,
you can talk about them without explaining them. If you don't know about them, it's easy to google as there's lots of articles on the subject using
the same name.

## All of Captain's compositions have names

And we hope they help you to talk about these compositions with other developers and your own teams.

Have a look through the Layout Objects section of the documentation to see common objects such as [the Wrapper](/docs/wrapper), [the Stack](/docs/stack) or
[the Cluster](/docs/cluster).
