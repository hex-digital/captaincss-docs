## <Heading hidden>Common Language Overview</Heading>

One of CaptainCSS' core concepts is to provide a shared language for common, repetitive layout objects. 

While Tailwind has removed the need to overuse [semantic class names](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/),
it has also meant we've lost some terminology that was becoming industry standard.

As an example, see below a common layout object, created first using Tailwind utilities, and then later using an industry-standard
layout object.

Can you tell what the layout object is from the first snippet? **What would you call it** if you wanted to talk about it with another developer?

<TipBad>Using Tailwind to re-create common layout objects</TipBad>

```html lightBlue
<div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 md:px-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-10">
  ...
</div>
```

<TipGood>Using battle hardened, industry standard layout objects</TipGood>

```html lightBlue
<div class="wrapper">
  ...
</div>
```

The obvious choice is to move the first snippet into a component, perhaps called a `BaseWrapper`.

However, this too has several downsides:

- It means another boilerplate component that needs to be created at the start of each project
- It's not easily shared between projects that use different frontend frameworks or application
- It's not easily configurable in tailwind.config.js, and so not easily shared between tailwind projects
- It could be called something non-standard, like Container, MaxWidth or ContentBox
- It's no longer easily standardised between projects, as it's a project specific component
- It runs the risk of being modified, as any component does, which may have wide reaching consequences for the project

The next logical step is to extract it to a Tailwind plugin to counteract all the above points, and that's exactly what Captain is.

A set of layout objects, battle hardened and in use across hundreds of websites, now sat atop Tailwind and its brilliant ecosystem.

In fact, **Tailwind already has a layout object** itself: [The Container](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/container).

### What are objects?

A brief intermission to talk about objects, or layout objects.

Layout objects are the reusable abstractions of repetitive, shared and purely structural aspects of UI. This means things
like wrappers, containers, stacks, clusters, etc.

"It allows them to exist as non-cosmetic styles that handle the skeletal aspect of a lot of UI components, without ever actually
looking like designed 'things'." - [Harry Roberts - CSS Wizardry](https://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/).

In other words, adding layout objects to a page on their own wouldn't show anything, but when putting content in to them, they
shape how the content sits on the page. They define the layout of that content.

## Why naming is important

More than likely, you're already using one or more of these layout objects. After all, they've been around for a long time.

It's possible though, that you are building them from scratch each time you work on a project. Or that your team does not 
have a single, shared name for each object.

CaptainCSS provides both the implementation for these objects, and the shared language that comes with it.

Naming concepts and patterns is what makes them easy to talk about. Without a common name, developers would need to re-explain 
a particular concept each time they wanted to talk about it, or risk not being on the same page.

Have a look through the Layout Objects section of the documentation to see common objects such as [the Wrapper](/docs/wrapper), [the Stack](/docs/stack) or
[the Cluster](/docs/cluster). Think about how you would have approached such a design on previous projects, and compare it to how you can do it with Captain.

We hope you'll see how easy Captain makes it.
