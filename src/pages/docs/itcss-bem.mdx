## <Heading hidden>Overview</Heading>

CaptainCSS is built to ensure it is both easy to read, and brilliantly scalable.

It does this by leveraging methodologies that have proven themselves over the past decade.

Code is inherently harder to read than it is to write. This is why making code easier to read is extremely important.

Read on to discover how Captain makes use of ITCSS for structure, and BEM for class naming. 

## ITCSS and prefixes: easy to understand and scale

With the many utility classes already available, and the numerous plugins you may create or add, it can become difficult
to see which classes are standardised layout objects, and which are focused, specific utilities.

```html lightBlue
<section class="mb-4 wrapper">
  <div class="grid grid-cols-4 gap-4 mt-6">
      <div class="col-span-4 mb-12">
          <div class="justify-end stack">
            <a href="/a-great-link">
                <div class="bg-grey-400 frame">
                    <img alt="" src="/images/header-image.jpg">
                </div>
            </a>
            <time datetime="2021-01-01">01-01-2021</time>
          </div>
  ...
```

Notice the objects? They blend in with all the utilities. If we could pick them out, they would give us a much clearer picture of
a pages skeletal model without having to see the page.

Luckily this problem was solved years ago, with the advent of ITCSS (<abbr>Inverted Triangle CSS</abbr>).

ITCSS is a fantastic CSS folder structure and naming convention. It logically groups classes in a way that is easy to understand
and scales extremely well. We can apply a classname prefix to help identify the layers in HTML.

- Settings
- Tools
- Generic
- Elements
- Objects `.o-`
- Components `.c-`
- Utilities `.u-`

For more information on ITCSS, read [ITCSS: Scalable and Maintainable CSS Architecture](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/).

The important part is that Tailwind classes form our Utilities layer, and Captain adds objects to the Objects layer.

To differentiate them in the code, we can apply a prefix to all the classes:

```html lightBlue
<section class="o-wrapper u-mb-4">
  <div class="u-grid u-grid-cols-4 u-gap-4 u-mt-6">
      <div class="u-col-span-4 u-mb-12">
          <div class="o-stack u-justify-end">
            <a href="/a-great-link">
                <div class="o-frame u-bg-grey-400">
                    <img alt="" src="/images/header-image.jpg">
                </div>
            </a>
            <time datetime="2021-01-01">01-01-2021</time>
          </div>
  ...
```

In the above example, all objects have a `o-` prefix, and all utilities have a `u-` prefix.

Read about how to configure your prefixes on [the prefixes page](/docs/prefixes).

If you would prefer not to prefix your Tailwind classes, you can leave those unprefixed, and just prefix the objects, too.

Lastly, if you do have a components layer, you can prefix those with `c-` as well. An example would be Captain's
[Skip Link](/docs/skip-link) accessibility component.

Harry Roberts talks about this naming convention in more detail in [BEMIT: Taking the BEM Naming Convention a Step Further](https://csswizardry.com/2015/08/bemit-taking-the-bem-naming-convention-a-step-further/).

## BEM naming: ease burden of reading code

The last part of the puzzle is improving readability of all the class names.

Some layout objects will have modifiers that change them, such as the spacing they add or their max width.

Some may even have children elements, like [`o-wrapper`](/docs/wrapper), which has classes that can be applied to break a
child element out of the wrapper temporarily.

Code is already much harder to read than it is to write, so it's important we are able to ease this burden.

Thankfully, there's a naming convention called BEM (<abbr>Block, Element, Modifier</abbr>) that makes these classes easy to read.

```html lightBlue
<div class="o-wrapper o-wrapper--lg">
  <div class="o-wrapper__bleed">Content</div>
</div>
```

A block, like `o-wrapper` designates a particular layout object. Blocks can have modifiers, such as `o-wrapper--lg`, that
states the block has been modified in some way - in this case, it's a wider, large version.

Elements, such as `o-wrapper__bleed`, are children of a block. They do something related to a block, and should always live inside of a block.
They too can have modifiers.

BEM makes reading and interpreting related classes much easier. All of Captain's objects implement ITCSS and BEM naming to keep them clear.
